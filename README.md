# ROSPy Tutorial
My rospy tutorial.

## Prerequisites
* Studied a least one (common) programming languague on beginner level.  

## Questions
1. Given a common programming language that you don't know, do you think that language is **LIKELY** to have:
* Variables of different types.
* If-else condition (or similar).
* For Loop.
* While Loop.
* Function Call. 
* Common programming paradigms (e.g. Object-Oriented programming).
* Containers/Data Structures.

2. If **MOST** of the answer from question 1 is **YES**, do you think they are enough to construct many (simple) robotics projects?

## Exercises 
1. Construct an Python program with a **variable x** (can be a constant or user-defined) that:
* Print "forward" if x is equal to 1.
